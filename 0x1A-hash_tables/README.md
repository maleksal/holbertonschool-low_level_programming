# 0x1A. C - Hash tables

Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When you will be done with this project, you will be able to better understand the power and simplicity of Python dictionaries

## General
- What is a hash function
- What makes a good hash function
- What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
- What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
- What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
- What are the most common use cases of hash tables

## Used Data Structures
```
/**
 * struct hash_node_s - Node of a hash table
 *
 * @key: The key, string
 * The key is unique in the HashTable
 * @value: The value corresponding to a key
 * @next: A pointer to the next node of the List
 */
typedef struct hash_node_s
{
     char *key;
     char *value;
     struct hash_node_s *next;
} hash_node_t;

/**
 * struct hash_table_s - Hash table data structure
 *
 * @size: The size of the array
 * @array: An array of size @size
 * Each cell of this array is a pointer to the first node of a linked list,
 * because we want our HashTable to use a Chaining collision handling
 */
typedef struct hash_table_s
{
     unsigned long int size;
     hash_node_t **array;
} hash_table_t;

```
